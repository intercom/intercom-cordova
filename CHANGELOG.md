---

Update guide:

1. If you have not already done so, update your `cordova-cli`:
    ```
    npm install -g cordova
    cd my_project
    cordova platform remove android
    cordova platform add android@7.0.0
    ```
2. Update `plugin-cordova-intercom`:
    ```
    cordova plugin remove cordova-plugin-intercom
    cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-intercom
    ```
3. Ensure your config.xml specifies an android-minSdkVersion at or above 19:
    * `<preference name="android-minSdkVersion" value="19" />`
4. To use push on Android:
    * Ensure you've added `<preference name="intercom-android-push-type" value="FCM"/>` to your config.xml
    * Copy your FCM `google-services.json` file to the root directory of your project.

_NB: The above steps may not be exhaustive and are dependent on your app and system Cordova configuration_
