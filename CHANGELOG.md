**Enable mobile users to help themselves with the new mobile SDK for iOS and Android ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ˜ƒ**

The new Intercom mobile SDK brings the Messenger Home to your mobile applications. This means you can add messenger apps that allow your users to self-serve instead of starting a conversation. Users can now quickly access relevant help articles, review pinned content, and view product status in real time â€“ all from the messenger home screen.

* Fix issue with Intercom pod not being updated / installed when GitHub response was not 200 OK: [#246](https://github.com/intercom/intercom-cordova/pull/246)

## 5.0.1 (2018-01-23)

* Removes dependency on `PackageManager.GET_META_DATA`, which Cordova does not appear to generate any longer for new projects: [#239](https://github.com/intercom/intercom-cordova/issues/239).

## 5.0.0 (2018-01-22)

* Supports `cordova-android` 7.0.0, the default Android build version when using `cordova-cli` 8.0.0, though it may also be specified on earlier versions (tested on [Cordova 7.1.0](https://github.com/apache/cordova-cli/releases/tag/7.1.0))

* Deprecates GCM as a push type in favor of FCM. This includes removing the ability to specify a GCM/FCM sender id directly from config.xml. To use push on Android, adding your google-services.json to the root of your project is now required.

* Per the [`cordova-android` 7.0.0 release notes](cordova.apache.org/announcements/2017/12/04/cordova-android-7.0.0.html), the minimum Android API version supported is now API Level 19.

---

Update guide:

1. If you have not already done so, update your `cordova-cli`:
    ```
    npm install -g cordova
    cd my_project
    cordova platform remove android
    cordova platform add android@7.0.0
    ```
2. Update `plugin-cordova-intercom`:
    ```
    cordova plugin remove cordova-plugin-intercom
    cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-intercom
    ```
3. Ensure your config.xml specifies an android-minSdkVersion at or above 19:
    * `<preference name="android-minSdkVersion" value="19" />`
4. To use push on Android:
    * Ensure you've added `<preference name="intercom-android-push-type" value="FCM"/>` to your config.xml
    * Copy your FCM `google-services.json` file to the root directory of your project.

_NB: The above steps may not be exhaustive and are dependent on your app and system Cordova configuration_
